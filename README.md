# Read and Write implementation experiment for Comprez library

This project sole purpose is to serve me as a maintainer for future reference for implementing read and write stream of bytes with tokio.
As of Comprez V0.2.5, Comprez did not implment any read or write feature under the hood. Im afraid this will clogged up the memory and slows down the programme when compressing large data. Hence, I believe read and write feature is neccessary for this.
